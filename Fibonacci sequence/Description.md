This is a program that I'm guessing every developer-beginner has written. Here's my latest take on the topic, again, in Python. Subsequent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are calculated recursively. Additionally, for optimization purposes, the results are saved in a dictionary variable serving as a cache. This also helps in calculating the golden ratio as these values have already been added to dictionary and do not need to be calculated again. Due to naming problems, all Fibonacci numbers are displayed up to the number provided by the user, but the first number listed is 0 and I consider it to be the 0th number of the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, when the user wants to display 19 numbers, 20 numbers will actually be displayed, from 0th to 19th. As this is the best solution that came to my mind at the moment. I also added exception handling related to division by zero to shorten and simplify the code as much as possible.
